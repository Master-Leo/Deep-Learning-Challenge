# Report on Neural Network Model

Diving deep into learning whether charity funding projects predict success utilizing nueral networks

# Overview

I was responsible for creating a model that will predict nonprofit funding success for applicants in their ventures. I was provided a dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict the outcomes of their funding applicants by Alphabet Soup. The usage of a csv contatining a total of 34,0000 organizations metadata were extracted and transformed to an ideal dataframe. Within that dataset it captured a variety of columns that were aided into testing and training the neural netowrk model, such as: 
- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- - STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
